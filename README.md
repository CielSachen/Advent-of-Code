My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems throughout the years. The solutions are written in
Python and are not made with speed or memory efficiency in mind. I try to solve as many days as possible during the
event, and the remaining days after the event when I have the time for it.

## Included Solutions

✅ Solved during the event.\
